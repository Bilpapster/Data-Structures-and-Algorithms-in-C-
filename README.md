# Data Structures and Sorting Algorithms in C++

<h3>About</h3>

<p>This repository contains source code that implements several basic data structures, as well as usefull template sorting algorithms in C++. The codes were developped alongside with a University Course called "Data Stractures", that the author attended during his second semester of studies (February 2020 - May 2020) at Computer Science Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (CSD AUTh). </p>

<h3>Data Structures</h3>

<p>In this repository you can find source code in C++ to implement a basic version of the following Data Structures: </p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Template Priority Queue - Max Heap</p></li>
  <li><p>Open Address Hash Table for strings</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Sorting Algorithms</h3>

<p>In this repository you can find source code in C++ to implement an optimized version of the following sorting algorithms </p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Template In-place Randomized Quick Sort</p></li>
  <li><p>Template In-place Heap Sort</p></li>
  <li><p>Template Merge Sort</p></li>
</ul>
